# Java Coding Challenge #2

**Topic:** Strings
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem
Given a string, return true if it is a palindrome after removing non-alphanumeric chars and ignoring case.

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 200000

## Example
Input: A man, a plan, a canal: Panama
Output: true
Explanation: After cleanup: amanaplanacanalpanama, which is a palindrome.

## Approach
Use an optimal Java solution with clean naming and clear logic.
